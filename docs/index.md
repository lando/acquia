# Acquia

[Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) is the Enterprise Digital Experience Platform designed to help you build Drupal experiences that engage customers, enhance conversions and help your business stand out.

Lando provides an integration that:

* Closely mimics Acquia's stack, versions, and environment locally
* Allows you to easily [`pull`](./sync.md#pulling) your Acquia site down locally
* Allows you to easily [`push`](./sync.md#pushing) your changes back to Acquia
* Installs `drush`, `acli`, and other useful development tools.

To use this recipe, you must have an account and a site on Acquia. If you don't, you can sign up [here](https://id.acquia.com/signin/register?path=&site=cloud).

You can report any issues or feedback [over here](https://github.com/lando/acquia/issues/new/choose) or check out the [support page](./support.md).
