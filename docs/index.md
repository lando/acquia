# Overview

[Acquia](https://www.acquia.com/) is the Enterprise Digital Experience Platform designed to help you build Drupal experiences that engage customers, enhance conversions and help your business stand out.

Lando provides a snazzy integration that:

* Closely mimics Acquia's stack, versions and environment locally
* Allows you to easily `pull` your Acquia site down locally
* Allows you to easily `push` your changes back to Acquia
* Installs `drush`, `acli` and other power tools.

However, in order to profit, **you must** have an account and a site on Acquia to be able to use this recipe. If you don't, you can sign up [here](https://accounts.acquia.com/sign-up?path=&site=cloud).

You can report any issues or feedback [over here](https://github.com/lando/acquia/issues/new/choose) or check out the [support page](./support.md).
