# Manually Importing Your DB and Files

In the event that `lando pull` is not working as expected you have a few other things you can try out to grab your database and files.

## Database

```bash
# Use the ACLI directly
lando acli pull:db

# Download and import a database backup
lando db-import database.sql.gz
```

You can learn more about the `db-import` command [over here](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/db-import.html).

## Files

```bash
# Use the ACLI directly
lando acli pull:files
```tabase main < dump.sql
```
