# Acquia Lando Plugin

This is the _official_ [Lando](https://lando.dev) plugin for [Acquia](https://acquia.io). When installed it...

* Closely mimics Acquia's stack, versions and environment locally
* Allows you to easily `pull` your Acquia site down locally
* Allows you to easily `push` your changes back to Acquia
* Installs `drush`, `acli` and other power tools.

Of course, once a user is running their Acquia project with Lando they can take advantage of [all the other awesome development features](https://docs.lando.dev) Lando provides.


## Basic Usage

Clone a project down from Acquia.

```bash
# Make and go into an empty directory
mkdir myproject && cd myproject

# Go through interactive prompts to get your code from acquia
lando init --source acquia

# OR if you already have your acquia code locally
cd /path/to/repo
lando init \
  --source cwd \
  --recipe acquia

# Start it up
lando start

# Import your database and files
lando pull

# List information about this app.
lando info
```

Once your project is running you can access [relevant tooling commands](https://github.com/lando/acquia/blob/main/docs/usage.md#application-tooling).
